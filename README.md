### This repository will eventually be moved to the [Multiscale Physics of Living Systems Group](https://github.com/MPoLS-lab)'s GitHub.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code, figures and report of my master thesis, titled "Center-based modelling of embryonic organoid development", developed as part of the Master's degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya. It was carried out at the Computational Biology and Complex Systems research group ([BIOCOM-SC](https://biocomsc.upc.edu/en), and supervised by [David Oriola Santandreu](https://davidoriola.mystrikingly.com/). The model has been programmed using [CellBasedModels.jl](https://github.com/dsb-lab/CellBasedModels.jl), the Julia package for multicellular modelling.

## Installation process

The following instructions provide a guide to set up your computer to run the code, and been tested to work on Linux and Windows.

Download Julia from [their website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Download version 1.9 and, optionally, set it as default and remove the release version.

```
juliaup add 1.9
juliaup default 1.9
juliaup rm release
```

Run Julia.
```
julia
```
In case 1.9 is not the default version, run
```
julia +1.9
```

Add CellBasedModels.jl and the packages used across the code
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg
julia> add CellBasedModels
julia> add DifferentialEquations, Distributions, Random, GLMakie, Printf, Dates, Glob, NBInclude, MathTeXEngine, IJulia
```
Note that IJulia is only necessary to run the notebooks in Jupyter notebooks. You can use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install). Another option is to use VS Code along with the Julia extension.

## Examples

Here are some examples of plots created using the code.

Formation of an aggregate:
